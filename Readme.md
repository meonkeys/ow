ow - Nextcloud command-line client

## Introduction

ow (like, you're trying to say "owl" and almost succeed) is your handy local command-line pal for Nextcloud. Perform various operations to enhance local editing, collaboration, and more.

Output is generally minimal on success. If an error occurs, messages are printed to standard error and a nonzero exit code is returned.

## Usage

### Help

List available actions.

```bash
ow --help
```

### Create album from folder

Add all media in a folder to an album. 

```bash
ow dir-album "Photos/2020/Camping trip"
```

This works directly against the Nextcloud WebDAV API; the desktop client is not required.

This command expects that the provided path contains media compatible with the Photos and Memories apps (generally just photos and videos). Sub-folders and non-compatible file types are ignored.

#### convert many folders to albums

Example Python script for converting a bunch of folders to albums at once:

```python
import subprocess

folders = [
    'Photos/2020/Camping trip',
    'Photos/2021/sunny day'
]

for folder in folders:
    subprocess.run(['./ow', 'dir-album', folder])
```

### Get internal link

Given a local file path sync'd by the Nextcloud desktop client, return the "internal link" on the Nextcloud server.

```
$ ow internal-link ~/Nextcloud/test.md
https://cloud.example.com/f/229
```

### Lock

Lock a file. Requires the [Temporary files lock app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_lock).

```
$ ow lock ~/Nextcloud/test.md
```

Locking indicates to other users your wish to avoid conflicts in shared files.

### Unock

Unlock a file. Requires the [Temporary files lock app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/files_lock).

```
$ ow unlock ~/Nextcloud/test.md
```

## Installation

* clone this repository, or just grab the `ow` script
* install required dependencies
    * Python 3
    * Python `requests` library (via e.g. `pip install requests` or `apt install python3-requests`)
* install optional dependencies
    * Nextcloud desktop sync client (for lock, unlock, internal-url; not needed for dir-album)
    * `xmllint` at `/usr/bin/xmllint` (for debugging API responses)
        * on Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install libxml2-utils`
* create config file based on example below
* optional: put the script in your path
    * example: `ln -s ~/git/meonkeys/ow/ow ~/.local/bin`

### example config

Create `~/.config/ow/ow.ini` and customize, following the example below:

```ini
[server]
baseUrl = http://localhost:8080
username = admin
# If you use multi-factor auth, use an app password here.
password = admin

[local]
# If you use the Nextcloud Desktop client, set this to indicate where files are sync'd.
# Required for lock, unlock, and internal-url.
# Not needed for dir-album.
syncFolder = /home/joeuser/Nextcloud
```

## Architecture

ow is written in Python. It examines local files sync'd by the [Nextcloud desktop client](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/) for some operations, and talks with the [Nextcloud WebDAV API](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/client_apis/WebDAV/basic.html) for others.

## History

ow [started](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/get-internal-link-for-a-file-in-nextcloud-from-a-local-command-line/152774) with one command (get internal link for locally sync'd file).

## Ideas

* add more features
    * post chat messages
    * add a task
    * add a calendar event
    * search
* improve setup
    * automate install
* improve config
    * read and use config from Nextcloud desktop client
    * [read and use secrets from desktop/OS password manager](https://pypi.org/project/keyring/) or smartcard
* improve code maintainability
    * use a real argument parser (DONE)
    * add tests
* improve cross-platform compatibility
    * currently only built for and tested on recent Ubuntu LTS
    * add Windows support
    * add macOS support
* pick a better name?
* use a real contributor agreement
* Are there other/better free software utilities like this one? List/promote them.
* Would it make more sense to implement this and the other feature ideas (above) within the [official client](https://docs.nextcloud.com/desktop/latest/advancedusage.html)?
    * [Do the maintainers want these features?](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues?q=label%3A%22feature%3A+%3Awhite_square_button%3A+nextcloudcmd%22+)
* support programmable completion
    * handle spaces (in directories and filenames) gracefully
    * generate completions [from the python script itself](https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/)
    * see also: [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14597466/custom-tab-completion-in-python-argparse), [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9568611/how-does-argparse-and-the-deprecated-optparse-respond-to-tab-keypress-after), and [this](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/02/14/bash-programmable-completion/)
